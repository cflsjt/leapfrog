LeapFrog
========

A set of tools that allows the genomic localization of (flanking
regions of) repetitive elements based on read-pair information.

analysis steps & data sets are:

* (1) input fastq
  The paired-end fastq files generated from the organism that you are
  interested in. This MUST be paired end!
* (2) reference fasta
  Contains the genome reference sequence
* (3) element_database
  The database is a multi-fasta file elements that are to be
  located. The software expects the sequence headers to have the
  following format: `>NAME#FAMILY`
* (4) bowtie2db for the reference fasta
  bowtie2 database based on (2)
* (5) bowtie2db for the element database  
  bowtie2 database based on (3)
* (6) get danglers
  the leapfrog script `lf_danglers` will run bowtie2 in the background
  and output a properly renamed fastq file containing the
  "danglers". A "dangler" is a read that does not map to the element
  database (3), but it's paired end mate does!

                             ____
                            /    \
                       =====      =====   <- dangler
        +==================+      
        | ELEMENT DATABASE |
        +==================+
  
  

  Check how to run the script using the `-h` parameter. This script
  takes as input the element bowtie2 database (5) and the input fastq
  (1).



* (7) map the danglers to the reference genome
  run a regular bowtie2 job mapping the dangler sequences (6) against
  the reference genome
* (8) extract PFR's 
  based on the danglers mapping to the
